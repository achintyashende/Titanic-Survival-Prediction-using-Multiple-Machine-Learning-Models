# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-using-Multiple-Machine-Learning-Models
This GitHub repository presents a Titanic survival prediction project employing diverse machine learning models. We utilize Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Decision Tree Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest Classifier to predict passenger survival.
